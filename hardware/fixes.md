## GPIO RNG
* addr(1) and addr(2) are connected to the opposite nets on the bus. (Workaround in UCF).

## Program counter
* Missing WE LED.

## Mem page
* Missing pull-downs on programmer pins. (Workaround with programmer driving low).

## RAM
* Doesn't seem to drive the data bus with enough current for the LEDs.

## General
* Orange LEDs are too dim.
